# Node File Explorer

A lightweight, web-based file explorer built with Node.js, designed to provide an intuitive interface for navigating, managing, and interacting with files and directories on a server.

## About

Node File Explorer is a simple yet powerful tool that allows users to browse, upload, download, and manage files through a browser-based interface. Built using Node.js, this project leverages the power of server-side JavaScript to interact with the file system, offering a responsive and customizable solution for file management. Whether you're looking to manage files on a local server or deploy it as a remote file explorer, this project provides a solid foundation with minimal dependencies.

## Features

- **File Navigation**: Browse directories and view file details with ease.
- **File Management**: Upload, download, delete, and rename files directly from the interface.
- **Lightweight**: Built with minimal dependencies for fast performance.
- **Customizable**: Easily extend or modify the codebase to suit your needs.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on any system with Node.js installed.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnshulAgrawal999/node-file-explorer.git
   cd node-file-explorer
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
   By default, the explorer will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`. You can modify the port or other settings in the configuration file (if applicable).

## Usage

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the configured port).
- Use the interface to explore directories, upload files, or perform other file operations.
- Customize the root directory by updating the configuration or passing it as a command-line argument (e.g., `node index.js --dir /path/to/directory`).

## Configuration

Edit the `config.js` file (if present) or pass command-line arguments to customize the application:

- `--port`: Set the port number (default: 3000).
- `--dir`: Specify the root directory to explore (default: current directory).

Example:
```bash
node index.js --port 8080 --dir /home/user/files
```
